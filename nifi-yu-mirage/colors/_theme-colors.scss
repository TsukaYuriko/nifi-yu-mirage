/*
All "theme" colors are defined here.
These are roughly categorized into contexts where they are used.
Stylesheets always reference the theme colors, never the source colors directly.
This makes it possible to change specific usages of potentially-identical colors without
changing EVERY usage of that color, keeping the theme as modular as possible.
This two-tier structure also preserves integrity of the source colors so they can be
traced to their origins while also providing friendly names for actual use.
